The content of this repository is composed of the programming assignments given by Prof. Rabbany for the COMP 551 course during the Winter 2020 semester at McGill University. All assignments are written in Python.


## Contents

- Assignment 1 - Machine Learning 101: Implemention and comparison of two classification techniques (Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) on 4 different datasets â€” These models were built from scratch, without the use of pre-existing implementations or functions as found in SciKit learn or any other library.
- Assignment 2 - Text Classification: Development of models to classify textual data found in 2 datasets, where the inputs were text documents, and output were categorical variables (class labels). These models were built using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Ada Boost and Random Forest algorithms.
- Assignment 3 - Image Classification: Development of Convolutional Neural Network and Multilayer Perceptron to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset with the default test and train partitions.
